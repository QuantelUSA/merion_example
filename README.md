# merion_example

This is a simple example program showing how to communicate with the Merion C laser. Just run the program in Python (version 3.7 or later), and enter the laser's IP address to test out communications.

The program will probably work with earlier versions of Python, but you may have to remove some the "type hints" in the code since earlier versions of Python may not understand those.
